farmOS 2.x is a complete rewrite of farmOS for [Drupal 9](https://www.drupal.org/about/9).
This brings many improvements, modernizations, and new features. The following
is a brief summary of notable changes from the 1.x branch of farmOS (aka
`7.x-1.x` for Drupal 7).

Detailed release notes will be included in this file with each new release
moving forward.

### Notable changes from farmOS 1.x

- Data model
  - [Documented data model](https://farmOS.org/model)
  - [Areas are now types of Assets](https://farmos.org/development/api/changes/#areas)
  - New Asset types: Land, Structure, Water, Material, Seed
  - Planting Assets are renamed to Plant

  - [Inventory tracking](https://farmos.org/model/logic/inventory/) for all
    Asset types
  - Improved [Asset location](https://farmos.org/model/logic/location/) logic,
    including the ability to designate Assets as "fixed" (with intrinsic
    geometry) and/or "locations" (allowing other Assets to be moved to them)
  - Improved [Group membership](https://farmos.org/model/logic/group/) logic,
    including member inheritence of group location
  - Support for [Quantity types](https://farmos.org/model/type/quantity/#type)
  - Revisions for tracking changes to records
  - Improved "Data streams" framework for sensors and other time-series data
    collection
  - ID tags on all Asset types
  - Flags can be limited by record type
- User interface/experience (UI/UX)
  - Improved location hierarchy drag-and-drop editor, including ability to edit
    sub-hierarchies
  - Improved KML/KMZ importer for bulk Land Asset creation
  - Geocoding of GeoJSON and GPX files (in addition to KML/KMZ) on individual
    Assets and Logs

  - [Documented API changes](https://farmos.org/development/api/changes/)
  - Modernized RESTful API built on [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/)
  - [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for all API resources
  - 2.x API support in [farmOS.js](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS.js) and
    [farmOS.py](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS.py) libraries
  - Updated [farmOS-map](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-map) library based on
    [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)
  - Improved APIs for [module builders](https://farmos.org/development/module/)
  - Object-oriented architecture based on [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
  - Dependency management via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
  - Automated testing via [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and
    [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/actions)
  - Coding standards enforcement via [CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
  - Feature branch previews via [Tugboat](https://www.tugboat.qa/)
- Hosting
  - PostgreSQL database support (alongside MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite3)
  - [Automated migration](https://farmos.org/hosting/migration/) from 1.x to 2.x
  - Improved performance with lazy-loading code and caching options
  - Improved support for translation/localization (l10n)
- Security
  - Support from the [Drupal Security Team](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team)
  - Drupal 9 will be supported (with security updates) until November 2023.
  - Drupal 10 will be released mid-2022. farmOS will be prepared to update as
    soon as possible. This process will be trivial compared to the upgrade from
    Drupal 7, which required a complete refactor of the codebase. By comparison,
    updating from Drupal 9 to 10 will simply involve updating deprecated code.
