## [3.0.0-beta1] 2023-11-01

This is the first release of the farmOS 3.x branch, following
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means changes have been made which may be
incompatible with existing integrations. These "breaking" changes are described
below, with links to specific issues/pull requests for more details.

farmOS v3 updates Drupal to version 10. Drupal 9 is end-of-life as of
[November 1st, 2023](https://www.drupal.org/docs/understanding-drupal/drupal-9-release-date-and-what-it-means/how-long-will-drupal-9-be-supported).
If you have built any add-on modules for farmOS, you will need to check that
they are compatible with Drupal 10, and declare support in your `*.info.yml`
file by changing `core_version_requirement` from `^9` to `^9 || ^10` (to
indicate that it works on both versions), or just `^10` (to indicate that it
only works on Drupal 10). The PHPStan tool that is included with the farmOS
`3.x-dev` Docker image can be used to perform static analysis of your module
code to see if there are deprecations that need to be fixed. See
[farmOS coding standards](https://farmos.org/development/environment/code/) for
more information.

If you are using PostgreSQL, Drupal 10 requires PostgreSQL version 12 or
greater, with the `pg_trgm` extension enabled. If you have PostgreSQL 13 or
greater, the `pg_trgm` extension will be enabled automatically during farmOS
installation. PostgreSQL 12 users, or users who are updating from farmOS 2.x to
3.x, will need to enable it manually by running the following query after the
farmOS database has been created, but before farmOS is installed/updated:
`CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;`

The [Simple OAuth](https://www.drupal.org/project/simple_oauth) module has been
updated to version 6. This includes a few breaking changes which may affect API
integrations. farmOS includes code to handle the transition of its own OAuth
clients and scopes, but if you have made any additional clients that used
special roles they will also need to be updated. The biggest changes are that
the "Implicit" grant type has been removed, and the "Password Credentials" grant
type has been moved to an optional "Simple OAuth Password Grant" module, which
must be enabled in order to use that grant type. The default farmOS client that
is included with farmOS has also been moved to a separate module that is not
enabled by default. After the update to farmOS 3.x, all access tokens will be
invalidated, but refresh tokens will still work to get a new access token.

farmOS 2.x included code to help migrate data from a farmOS 1.x database. This
code has been removed from farmOS 3.x If you are still on farmOS 1.x, you will
need to *migrate* to farmOS 2.x, and then *update* to farmOS 3.x. For more
information, see
[Migrating from farmOS v1](https://farmOS.org/hosting/migration/).

Lastly, the following deprecated functions/methods have been removed:

- `farm_log_asset_names_summary()`
- `QuickFormInterface::getId()`

### Changed

### Fixed

- [Quick form actions cause RouteNotFoundException: Route farm.quick.[id] does not exist. #727](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/issues/727)

## [2.2.0] 2023-10-06

This is the second minor release of the farmOS 2.x branch, following
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means new functionality is
added in a backwards compatible manner.

farmOS 2.2.0 adds a CSV import module with importers for all asset, log, and
taxonomy term types, as well as a framework for module developers to build
their own custom importers for bespoke CSV templates. See
https://farmOS.org/development/module/csv for more information.

A new Group membership assignment quick form is provided for easily assigning
asset group membership. This works similar to the Movement quick form that was
added in v2.1.0.

This release also makes a number of UI/UX improvements, including a new Setup
menu item which will serve as a place for common "farm data setup" tasks.

## [2.1.0] 2023-05-19

This is the first minor release of the farmOS 2.x branch, following
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). This means new functionality is
added in a backwards compatible manner.

farmOS 2.1.0 adds two quick forms that were present in farmOS 1.x. The Birth
quick form makes it easy to record animal births, by creating the birth log and
children animal assets all in one step. The Movement quick form (formerly the
Animal Movement quick form in 1.x) makes it easy to record the movement of
assets to a new location, with the option of customizing their geometry at the
same time.

In editable maps, it is now possible to paste WKT into the textarea below the
map and the map geometry will be automatically updated.

This release also moves the "View", "Edit", and "Revisions" links on assets,
logs, plans, and taxonomy terms from primary tabs to secondary tabs, to create
a better separation from the other primary tabs.

### Added

- [Refresh map edit layer when WKT is pasted into data input field #670](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/pull/670)

## [2.0.0-rc1] 2022-12-15

PHP 8+ is now the recommended minimum version requirement for farmOS. The

[end-of-life](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) was November 28th,
2022. farmOS still works with PHP 7.4 as of this writing, but support is not
officially guaranteed moving forward. If you maintain a farmOS module, please
test that it works with PHP 8. If you host farmOS, please upgrade PHP to 8+ as
soon as possible.

### Added

- [Issue #3186530: farmOS 2.x PHP 8 support](https://www.drupal.org/project/farm/issues/3186530)

### Changed

- [Issue #3308740: Update Drush to ^11](https://www.drupal.org/project/farm/issues/3308740)

## [2.0.0-beta8] 2022-11-25

This release fixes an issue with the input log migration from farmOS v1. If you
have migrated input logs from farmOS v1, and they referenced multiple material
types, they may have been affected. An update hook is included with this
release that will attempt to re-connect to the v1 database used during
migration to automatically fix the issue. If the v1 database is no longer
available, then you will need to fix these logs manually. For more information,
see: https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/issues/579

If you would like to skip the automatic fix, add the following line to your
`settings.php` (this can be removed after running update.php):

`$settings['farm_migrate_skip_input_log_migration_fix'] = TRUE;`

### Added

- [Add action to bulk categorize logs #590](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/pull/590)
- [Add action for bulk assigning asset parent #588](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/pull/588)

## [2.0.0-beta1] 2022-01-01

farmOS 2.x is a complete rewrite of farmOS for [Drupal 9](https://www.drupal.org/about/9).
This brings many improvements, modernizations, and new features. The following
is a brief summary of notable changes from the 1.x branch of farmOS (aka
`7.x-1.x` for Drupal 7).

Detailed release notes will be included in this file with each new release
moving forward.

### Notable changes from farmOS 1.x

- Data model
  - [Documented data model](https://farmOS.org/model)
  - [Areas are now types of Assets](https://farmos.org/development/api/changes/#areas)
  - New Asset types: Land, Structure, Water, Material, Seed
  - Planting Assets are renamed to Plant
  - New Log types: Lab test (merged Soil and Water tests)
  - [Inventory tracking](https://farmos.org/model/logic/inventory/) for all
    Asset types
  - Improved [Asset location](https://farmos.org/model/logic/location/) logic,
    including the ability to designate Assets as "fixed" (with intrinsic
    geometry) and/or "locations" (allowing other Assets to be moved to them)
  - Improved [Group membership](https://farmos.org/model/logic/group/) logic,
    including member inheritence of group location
  - Support for [Quantity types](https://farmos.org/model/type/quantity/#type)
  - Revisions for tracking changes to records
  - Improved "Data streams" framework for sensors and other time-series data
    collection
  - ID tags on all Asset types
  - Flags can be limited by record type
- User interface/experience (UI/UX)
  - Improved location hierarchy drag-and-drop editor, including ability to edit
    sub-hierarchies
  - Improved KML/KMZ importer for bulk Land Asset creation
  - Geocoding of GeoJSON and GPX files (in addition to KML/KMZ) on individual
    Assets and Logs
  - Farm settings UI with simplified module installer
  - [Gin](https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/lullabot-podcast/gin-admin-theme-drupals-future-ui)
    admin theme
  - Improved mobile support
- APIs, libraries, and developer experience (DX)
  - [Documented API changes](https://farmos.org/development/api/changes/)
  - Modernized RESTful API built on [JSON:API](https://jsonapi.org/)
  - [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) for all API resources
  - 2.x API support in [farmOS.js](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS.js) and
    [farmOS.py](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS.py) libraries
  - Updated [farmOS-map](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS-map) library based on
    [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/)
  - Improved APIs for [module builders](https://farmos.org/development/module/)
  - Object-oriented architecture based on [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)
  - Dependency management via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
  - Automated testing via [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and
    [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS/actions)
  - Coding standards enforcement via [CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer)
  - Feature branch previews via [Tugboat](https://www.tugboat.qa/)
- Hosting
  - PostgreSQL database support (alongside MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite3)
  - [Automated migration](https://farmos.org/hosting/migration/) from 1.x to 2.x
  - Improved performance with lazy-loading code and caching options
  - Improved support for translation/localization (l10n)
- Security
  - Support from the [Drupal Security Team](https://www.drupal.org/drupal-security-team)
  - Drupal 9 will be supported (with security updates) until November 2023.
  - Drupal 10 will be released mid-2022. farmOS will be prepared to update as
    soon as possible. This process will be trivial compared to the upgrade from
    Drupal 7, which required a complete refactor of the codebase. By comparison,
    updating from Drupal 9 to 10 will simply involve updating deprecated code.
